Questions-
Which countries have the highest primary school dropout rates, and what might this suggest about educational access?
How does the upper secondary completion rate vary by country, and are there any notable trends?
What does the distribution of male youth literacy rates indicate about literacy across different countries?
Is there a relationship between birth rates and primary school completion rates, and does it differ by gender?
What does the treemap reveal about math and reading proficiency levels across different countries?

Answers-
South Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, and Eritrea have the highest dropout rates, with South Sudan reaching over 120%. These high dropout rates suggest significant challenges in educational retention, potentially due to socio-economic or political factors impacting access to consistent schooling.
The bar chart shows that upper secondary completion rates are high in some countries, exceeding 80-90%, but drop significantly in others. This variation suggests that while some countries are able to retain students through secondary education, others may face dropout issues before students reach this level, possibly due to economic or educational barriers.
The chart shows that literacy rates vary widely across countries, with many countries achieving over 90% literacy, while others fall below 50%. This suggests disparities in educational quality or access, with some countries likely struggling with resources or literacy-focused programs.
The line plot shows that higher birth rates generally correlate with lower primary completion rates for both genders, suggesting that countries with higher birth rates may face challenges in educational infrastructure or access. However, there is no strong visible difference between genders in completion rates related to birth rate.
The treemap shows variation in proficiency levels, with countries like Russia, France, and Argentina performing relatively well in both math and reading, while other countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Nicaragua have lower proficiency levels. This indicates disparities in educational outcomes, possibly related to the resources and emphasis placed on these subjects in different countries.
